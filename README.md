**Data Analysis with OpenAI API and Streamlit**

This is a data analysis project developed in Python using Streamlit and the OpenAI API via Langchain. The project allows for exploratory data analysis, generation of graphs, and conducting statistical tests interactively through a web application.

**Features**
Exploratory data analysis: Visualize descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for each variable in a dataset.

Graph generation: Create bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and other types of visualizations to explore patterns in the data.

Statistical tests: Conduct hypothesis tests, such as Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney test, to compare data groups and identify significant differences.

**How to Use**
Clone this repository to your local environment:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git

Install the necessary dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit application:streamlit run app.py

Upload your CSV file and answer questions in the designated fields, if desired.

Explore the data, generate visualizations, and conduct statistical tests using the interactive interface.

Note: The data analysis is performed automatically by the AI based on the uploaded dataset.
